Hi, this is my practice for the book "Constraint Solving And Planning With Picat", written by by Neng-Fa Zhou, HÃ¥kan Kjellerstrand and Jonathan Fruhman.

This book introduces a new logic-based multi-paradigm programming language that integrates logic programming, functional programming, dynamic programming with tabling, and scripting, for use in solving combinatorial search problems, including CP, SAT, and MIP (mixed integer programming) based solver modules, and a module for planning that is implemented using tabling.
